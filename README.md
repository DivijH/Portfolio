# Portfolio

See the portfolio online at http://www.divijhanda.in/

I made this portfolio from Scratch in Django. To run the above code on a local machine, install libraries mentioned in requirements.txt. Make sure to add the secret key in divijhanda/settings.py. To add the secret key, make a config.json file in the root folder and a key as 'SECRET_KEY'.
